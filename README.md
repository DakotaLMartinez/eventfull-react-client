# EventFull React Client

```bash
npx create-react-app eventfull-react-client
```

## Setting up React Router

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom
```

Clear out the boilerplate from 'create-react-app'. 
- Remove the index.css file, logo.svg, reportWebVitals, setupTests.js and App.css and App.test.js.
- Remove logos from public folder.
- Remove all references in index.js and App.js to the removed files
- Clear out the App component so it's empty
- Run `yarn start` to make sure the server boots up and we see an empty screen
